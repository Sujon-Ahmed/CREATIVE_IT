### What is PHP?

The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).
PHP Case Sensitivity

### Comments in PHP
A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Type of Comments <br>
-> Single line Comments <br>
-> Multi line Comments

### PHP Variables
Variables are "containers" for storing information. <br>
In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

<strong>Rules for PHP variables:</strong>
1. A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
3. A variable name cannot start with a number
4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
5. Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

<strong>Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!</strong>
